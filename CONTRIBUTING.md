If you want to contribute to the tutorial please clone or fork the repo and issue pull requests. This was designed with a specific class in mind, then used as a more general tutorial. The graphics used are pulled from Google with an intent to be instructional and we do not own any part of PyTorch, Numpy, or any other tools used in this tutorial. It is merely meant as an instructional device to help an upper level collegiate class understand ConvNets and deep learning as a whole. The repository is moderated by two users so give us time to review it and pull any requests.
