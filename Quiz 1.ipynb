    "### Quick Topics Quiz\n",

    "\n",
    "#### More General Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain the steps of a forward pass (i.e. what does a perceptron do with an input to get to the output).<br /><br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the image above, assuming we have 3 inputs (not including the bias) with **$x_1 = .5$, $x_2 = .7$, $x_3 = .2$** and weights initialized so that **$w_0 = .3$, $w_1 = .8$, $w_2 = .6$, $w_3 = .2$**. Finally, the expected output is **$.85$**, the **$\\alpha = .1$**, and the sigmoidal function is your activation function. What are each of the weights after executing the backpropagation algorithm and using stochastic gradient descent?<br /><br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain the difference between batch, mini-batch, and stochastic in terms of how it applies to Neural Networks.<br /><br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Name 4 commonly used activation functions. Then, choose 1 and explain a situation it would be beneficial to choose that specific function. Provide a reason why.<br /><br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific ConvNet Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is being optimized/updated in a Convolutional Neural Network?<br /><br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain how a convolutional layer is formed.<br /><br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a stride?<br /><br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are the benefits/problems with pooling layers?"
